/**
Subset client. Write a client program Subset.java that takes a command-line integer k; reads in a sequence of N strings from standard input using StdIn.readString(); and prints out exactly k of them, uniformly at random. Each item from the sequence can be printed out at most once. You may assume that k â‰¥ 0 and no greater than the number of string N on standard input. 
The running time of Subset must be linear in the size of the input. You may use only a constant amount of memory
plus either one Deque or RandomizedQueue object of maximum size at most N, where N is the number of strings on standard input.
(For an extra challenge, use only one Deque or RandomizedQueue object of maximum size at most k.)
